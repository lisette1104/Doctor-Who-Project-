    <td><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content Area" -->Lady Christina de Souza was a friend of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors, and had brief adventures with them both. A minor member of the British aristocracy, she was also a thief and an adrenaline junkie. Her exploits were well-publicised — at least in Britain — allowing Rory Williams to recognise her on sight. Christina de Souza was a notorious thief who stole for thrill, rather than profit as most thieves would; she was bored with her aristocratic upbringing. When she met the Tenth Doctor, Christina had already built a considerable reputation and was relentlessly pursued by Detective Inspector Macmillan. <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
