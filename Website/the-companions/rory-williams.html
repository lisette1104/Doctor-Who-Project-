    <td><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content Area" -->Rory Arthur Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.[1] Having been introduced at the start of the 5th series, Rory joins the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5.[2][3][4] As Amy Pond's fianc√©, Rory is initially insecure because he believes Amy secretly loves the Doctor more. Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy marry. The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth. In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;, Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend River Song is actually their daughter Melody Pond. The Doctor and River marry in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law. In &quot;The Angels Take Manhattan&quot;, the fifth episode of the seventh series, he and Amy are transported back in time by a Weeping Angel, leading to the couple's departure from the series.<br>
