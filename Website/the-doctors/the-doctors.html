<h1>THE DOCTORS</h1>
<p>The Doctor is the title character in the long-running BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who, and has also featured in two cinema feature films and one made-for-television film, as well as a vast range of spin-off novels, audio dramas and comic strips connected to the series.</p>
<p>To date, eleven actors have played the lead role in the television series, with continuity maintained by the ability of the character's species to regenerate. Several other actors have played the character on stage and film, in audio dramas, and in occasional special episodes of the series. The character's enduring popularity led the Daily Telegraph to dub him &quot;Britain's favourite alien&quot;.[1] The Doctor in his eleventh incarnation is played by Matt Smith, who took on the role in January 2010 and became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 2011.[2] On 1 June 2013, it was announced that Matt Smith would leave the series during the 2013 Christmas special.[3] On 4 August 2013, it was announced that Peter Capaldi would play the Doctor's twelfth incarnation.</p>
<p>The Doctor is a Time Lord,[4] an alien from the planet Gallifrey,[5] who travels through time and space in an internally vast time machine called the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space) which appears relatively small when seen from the outside, but is in fact infinite on the inside.[6]</p>
<p>The Doctor explores the universe at random, using his extensive knowledge of science, technology, and history to avert whatever crisis he encounters. The imprecise nature of his travels is initially attributed to the age and unreliability of the TARDIS's navigation system. However, the 1969 serial The War Games reveals that the Doctor actually stole the TARDIS, and subsequent stories such as Frontier in Space, Logopolis, &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, and &quot;The Doctor's Wife&quot; have incorporated this, and this theft was actually seen in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;. Additionally, it has been mentioned that the TARDIS is meant to be piloted by six Time Lords, rather than just one.[7] He was presumably unfamiliar with its systems, but was able to operate it correctly until his exile when the Time Lords wiped it from his memory. The Doctor initially had the manual for operating the TARDIS but destroyed it (by throwing it into a supernova) because he disagreed with it. After his trial and exile to twentieth century Earth, the Doctor still visits other planets on missions from the Time Lords who pilot the TARDIS to precise locations for him.</p>
<p>After his exile is lifted, the Doctor returns to his travels and demonstrates the ability to reach a destination of his own choosing more often than not. In the 2011 episode &quot;The Doctor's Wife&quot;, the Doctor tells the TARDIS (whose matrix, or soul, was temporarily transferred to the character Idris) that she has never been very reliable in taking him where he wanted to go. The TARDIS explains that she always took the Doctor where he needed to be. In &quot;Journey's End&quot;, the Doctor states that the reason for the previous bumpy navigation was that the TARDIS is meant to have six pilots, but in &quot;The Time of Angels&quot;, River Song demonstrates superior piloting skills and says the Doctor pilots the TARDIS &quot;with the brakes on&quot; (hence the classic noise), though she could have been teasing him. The Doctor generally travels with one or more companions. Most of these make a conscious decision to travel with him, but others, especially early in the series, are accidental passengers.</p>
