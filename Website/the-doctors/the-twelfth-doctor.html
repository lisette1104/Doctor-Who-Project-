      <h1>The Twelfth Doctor</h1>
      <p>Portrayed by- Peter Capaldi</p>
      <p>The Twelfth Doctor is to be the twelfth incarnation of the protagonist of the long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is to be portrayed by Peter Capaldi[1] following the departure of Matt Smith's incarnation in the 2013 Christmas special.[2] Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality. As such, this plot mechanism has allowed the Doctor to be portrayed by a series of actors over the decades since the series' inception in 1963.</p>
      <p>Capaldi will make his first appearance as the Doctor in the 2013 Christmas special episode.[3] He will be accompanied in the eighth series by incumbent companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman).</p>
