				<h1>The Companions</h1>
				<p>The Doctor almost always shares his adventures with up to three companions, and since 1963 more than 35 actors have been featured in these roles. The First Doctor's first companions were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin. Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning).</p>
				<p>Dramatically, the companions' characters provide a surrogate with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.</p>
				<p>In the 2005 revival, The Doctor generally travels with a single companion, although others may join later in the series. Companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors included Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate). The current Doctor's companions have included Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) and Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman).</p>
				<p>Less frequent companions, who may only appear for a few episodes, rather than an entire series, have included Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), River Song (Alex Kingston) and Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman). Since 2005, companions from the earlier series have also made returns alongside the new regulars. Sarah Jane Smith was the first of these, returning in 2005, and going on to feature in a Doctor Who spin-off, The Sarah Jane Adventures. Other companions have also appeared in this, along with other spin-offs, including Jo Grant, K-9, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. The character of Jack Harkness served to launch a further spin-off, Torchwood, in which Martha Jones has also appeared.</p>
